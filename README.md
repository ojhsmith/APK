# APK (Alcohol per krona) for iOS

This project is a simple iOS app that aims to help with finding the drink that gives the most 'bang for the buck'. It was built as an excersise in iOS development. 

<h2>Background</h2>

In Sweden the alcohol consumption is limited to the offers of 'Systembolaget'. I built this app as a fun way for me to learn Swift and I am grateful for any feedback on the code. As it is my first project I kept it small but more features are planned for the future such as inegration with the API from Systembolaget.

<h2>Usage</h2>

By entering the alcohol percentage, volume, and price, it calculates the amount of alcohol that you get for one swedish krona. You can save the value for later reference.
